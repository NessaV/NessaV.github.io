        <h2>Part A</h2>
        <h3>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>          
            <p>A very bold and flashy website. Layers upon layers of visual elements, like pop-up text boxes,
                 buttons cascading from the top. Pixel animations of flames, a monkey in a lab coat.
            
            <ul>
                <li>floating buttons</li>
                <li>flame animation</li>
                <li>so many ‘pop-up’ windows</li>
                <li>windows xp? 1998? style</li>
            </ul> 

        <h2>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
            <p>  
            <ol>
                <li>clicking on the floating buttons</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>‘x’</li>
                    <li>Debug</li>
                    <li>Help!!!</li>
                    <li>Retry</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>click ‘scream’ on one of the text boxes </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>(new tab) entered ‘w’.  “Void does not accept your scream”</li>
                    <li>entered ‘wwwwwwwwwww’. “”</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <li>clicked on the monkey (chimpanzee?)</li>
                    <br>
                <li>click ‘DO IT CYBERMONKEY!’
                    <br>(plays an animation, monkey, flashing images)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>click ‘close’
                        <br>(new setting, old pc desktop, 
                        skeleton bones, recycle bin with flames, home icon, light switch)
                    </li>
                    <li>clicking and throwing the bones around</li>
                    <li>clicked the light switch
                        <br>(hello Tatghoul)
                    </li>
                    <li>click the ghost
                        <br>(you can wake up the ghost or leave it be)
                    </li>
                    <li>click ‘wake her!’</li>
                    <li>click ‘yes, I am here for the password’</li>
                    <li>click ‘where is the gatekeeper?’</li>
                    <li>click ‘great, I am an excellent bone mage’</li>
                    <li>click ‘ok, will do. bye.’</li>
                    <li>click ‘I found the bones.’</li>
                    <li>click ‘wakeup, tatghoul!’
                        <br>(nothing happens, because I need to exit ‘dark mode’ and go ‘burn 
                        the bones’)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                End of my interactions
            </ol>
            <br>

        <h2>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
            <p>It’s hard to say which element specifically.</p>
            <p>One would be all of the visual icons, that represent the interface of a computer desktop screen. 
                There are little pixel arts denoting a recycle bin, a light switch, linked-computers icon (for network), etc.</p>
            <p>The artist does an amazing job of utilising our familiarity with using computers, and presents us with an entirely different experience 
                - because we are now focusing on clicking on things, not to do what we need to do, but to find out what the artist is trying to make us see. 
                The interactivity feels like playing a game, where you are finding clues, using that to guide your next actions,
                 and how to move to the next scene, solve the mystery.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
            <p>Clicking most of the time. But next would be reading.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
            <p>Usually, we see error messages as a bad sign. 
            In the case of a screen blowing up with numerous pop-up windows, we would believe our computer is overcome with a virus.</p>
            <p>Lawhead’s website has similar prefaces, but it is presented in a way that we no longer see it as real - a simulation. 
                Visual elements, which have been animated, move across the page. Pixel art flames burn in the background. […] In a bottom corner, is a monkey in a lab coat.</p>
            <p>It invites us to explore. To click on these objects. We question what their purpose is. 
                We get met with more banner notifications, with many clicks leading to little results or change in the setting, because new tabs get opened, and we are only able to close these ‘error messages’ one-by-one.</p>
            <p>The experience is akin to a game, there is mystery and unknown. 
                Whether we realise it or not, the whole experience gets you to navigate like a detective.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>6) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</h3>
            <p>If the goal of the experience is to continue exploring, starting from the start to explore every single option, then I think Lawhead’s Tetrageddon does this very well.</p>
            <p>You never know quite what to expect, and each click does the unexpected. New tabs are opened, new ‘worlds’ are shown, which you can’t click ‘back’ to just return to the previous page.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
            <p>I think this is an experience that you are meant to continue coming back to, and experiencing again and again. The experience is great in that it is suitable for any type of commitment, from a short, few minutes spent on the experience, or perhaps hours. There is just so much to unpack within Tetrageddon.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>8) What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
            <p>Tetrageddon feels modern yet retro. It is like a gameboy console, something you feel nostalgic for, yet you come back to rediscover it all over again. Although, Tetrageddon is very populated and full of hidden ‘easter eggs’. Perhaps this whole interactive experience has more hidden within it than we think games would have.</p>
